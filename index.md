1. I think that the most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was the relatikonship between conductor spans and weather stations. I find it quite interesting that many conductors share one common weather station. Additionally, downstream weather stations are also turned off if an upstream one is turned off first.
2. A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Q2 Project is to forecast potential PSPS events before they happen. Being able to do this would allow for SDGE to inform residents and people in the area of power shutoffs before they happen so that they can plan for it to happen.
3. A potential change I would make to the approach taken in the Q1 project is to find trends in the data to more specific weatherstations and the conductor spans they affect rather than generalizing the data to visualize it. We would also be likely utilizing some sort of predictive model to generate these predictions.
4. Techniques I would be interested in using is machine learning and deep learning to potentially find these trends in the data that lead to PSPS events.
